# Line-Integrals-and-Projections-and-Image-Reconstruction
A  line  integral  is  the  integral  of  a  physical  parameter  of  the  object  along  a  line.  For  the  case  of  x-ray tomography,  the  line  integral  is  the  total  attenuation  of  anx-ray  beam  when  the  ray  passes  through  the object  along  a  straight  line.  A  projection  function  can  be  formed,  by  combining  a  set  of  line  integrals corresponding  to  multiple  x-ray  beams.  In  parallel  projection,  the  object  is  illuminated  by  parallel  x-ray beams  and  line  integrals  for  each  case arecombined  to  form  a  projection.  Calculation  of  projections  for known attenuation coefficient distribution and incident beam intensity is defined as forward problemof x-ray imaging.  
Image  reconstruction  is  the  calculation  of  attenuation  coefficient  distribution  using  the  projections.  This process can also be named as the inverse problem. Depending on the nature of the problem, some filtering may be applied on the projection data before reconstruction.
